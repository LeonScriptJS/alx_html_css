# Headphones Landing Page

This project is a responsive landing page for a fictional headphone brand. It was created based on a Figma design provided in the ALX Front-End Web Development curriculum. The goal is to translate the design into clean, semantic HTML and responsive CSS.

## Project Summary

This project is a pixel-aware recreation of a designer Figma file using **only HTML and CSS** (no CSS frameworks, no JS except at Task 8). It emphasizes accessibility, semantic HTML, responsive design, and maintainable CSS.

Design reference: Figma file provided in the course. Fonts used in the design:
- `Source Sans Pro`
- `Spin Cycle OT`

If missing, install those locally for perfect parity.

## How to use

1. Clone the repo.
2. Place provided image assets inside `images/` (from `images_.zip`).
3. Place the icon font files from `holberton_school-icon.zip` in `fonts/` if used.
4. Open any `*-index.html` in a browser to see that stage.
5. The final interactive page is `8-index.html`.

---

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML tags (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `form`, `footer`)
- Visible focus styles
- `aria` attributes on interactive elements where appropriate
- Labels are associated with form controls

---

## Notes

- The mobile breakpoint is `480px` — layout switches at `max-width: 480px`.
- Links hover/active color: `#FF6565`.
- Button hover/active: `opacity: 0.9`.
- Max content width is `1000px`, centered.
- Some floating values from the Figma file are rounded for clarity.
